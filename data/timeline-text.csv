"What is football?","American football (referred to simply as football in the United States and Canada), also known as gridiron football, is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it, while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays; if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense, but if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive. Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins."
"Early History","Early history American football evolved from the sports of rugby and soccer. Rugby, like American football, is a sport in which two competing teams vie for control of a ball, which can be kicked through a set of goalposts or run into the opponent's goal area to score points. What is considered to be the first American football game was played on November 6, 1869, between Rutgers and Princeton, two college teams. They consisted of 25 players per team and used a round ball that could not be picked up or carried. It could, however, be kicked or batted with the feet, hands, head or sides, with the objective being to advance it into the opponent's goal. Rutgers won the game 6–4. Collegiate play continued for several years with matches played using the rules of the host school."
"Rule Changes","The sport saw many rules changes in its early years. Primarily in order to protect players. In 1882, tackling below the waist was legalized, and a static line of scrimmage was instituted. However, despite these new rules, football remained a violent sport. Dangerous mass-formations like the flying wedge resulted in serious injuries and deaths. A 1905 peak of 19 fatalities nationwide resulted in a threat by President Theodore Roosevelt to abolish the game unless major changes were made. In response, 62 colleges and universities met in New York City to discuss rule changes on December 28, 1905. These proceedings resulted in the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later renamed the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)."
"Structure","A football game is played between two teams of 11 players each. Playing with more on the field is punishable by a penalty. Teams may substitute any number of their players between downs; this 'platoon' system replaced the original system, which featured limited substitution rules, and has resulted in teams utilizing specialized offensive, defensive and special teams units."
"Offense","The offensive unit in football aims to move the ball down the field to score a touchdown. They must form a legal formation before play, with specific rules about player positions and numbers. The quarterback (QB), the offense's leader, calls plays and can pass, hand off, or run with the ball. The halfback/tailback (HB/TB) primarily carries the ball on running plays and can also receive passes, while the fullback (FB) mainly blocks but can run or catch in certain situations. The offensive line (OL), led by the center (C), blocks the defensive line to protect the ball carrier or quarterback. The line consists of guards (G) and tackles (T) who play specific roles in blocking. Wide receivers (WR) and tight ends (TE) are the main receivers, aiming to catch passes from the quarterback. Wide receivers line up near the scrimmage line and can also block or act as decoys, while tight ends, who line up outside the tackles, have dual roles in receiving and blocking."
"Defense","The defense in football aims to stop the offense from scoring by tackling the ball carrier or forcing turnovers (interceptions or fumbles). The defensive line (DL) includes defensive ends (DE) and defensive tackles (DT), responsible for stopping running plays, pressuring the quarterback, and enabling linebackers to penetrate. Linebackers, positioned between the defensive line and the defensive backfield, play various roles like defending against runs, pressuring the quarterback, and covering receivers. They are categorized into middle linebackers (MLB) and outside linebackers (OLB) and often lead the defense. The defensive backfield, or secondary, comprises cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S), with safeties further divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks primarily cover receivers, while safeties, positioned farther back, act as the last line of defense against deep passes and runs. Safeties also help in covering wide areas of the field."
"Special Teams","The special teams unit in football handles all kicking plays, including field goal (FG) attempts, punts, and kickoffs. For field goals and PAT (point-after-touchdown) plays, three key positions are involved: the placekicker (K or PK), holder (H), and long snapper (LS). The long snapper passes the ball to the holder, who then sets it up for the placekicker. During kickoffs, the ball is usually kicked from a tee, but a holder might be used in windy conditions. The player catching the ball on the receiving team is the kickoff returner (KR). For punt plays, the crucial positions are the punter (P), long snapper, upback, and gunner. The long snapper sends the ball directly to the punter, who kicks it before it hits the ground. Gunners, positioned outside the line, rush down the field to tackle the punt returner (PR)—the player catching the punt. Upbacks stand near the line of scrimmage, providing extra protection for the punter."
